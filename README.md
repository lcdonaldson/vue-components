## Various components made with Vue.js


I simply want to practice making functional components that are as modular as possible. 
I have tried to re-use many react-native, vue and even simple web components and found most of them to be fairly generic. I think it would be great
to make a series of components that just worked where ever you used them. That's what I hope this eventually becomes.

I anticipate a lot of sandbox efforts though until I get real good fully tested and composable components.
